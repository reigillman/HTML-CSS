<p>This is my logo made to reflect my interests and the type of content I create. I followed a color scheme throughout most of my projects and utilized it here as well. The biggest sign in this design is the whale, which directly correlates with the art I create. It is imagery I use often and I wanted to incorporate it here as well. The red star is also used as an eye-catching element; it compliments the simple round shape of the overall with rigid edges but it also have a vivd, blaring color. This was to catch the attention of my audience and stray away from the simple black and white color scheme. The typography used for my name is also simplistic but I edited the E slightly to create a visual oddity.</p>
