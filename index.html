	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm Rei Gillman and I'm a third-year student at Muskingum University in New Concord, Ohio. I transferred from Washington State Community College from studying computer support tech to computer science. I'm educated in building computers, configuring networks, and now I am currently learning to code software. In the future, I wish to work as a software developer.
	<br><br>I also greatly enjoy doing art as a hobby and have been drawing digitally for about a decade now. All of my art is done in Paint Tool Sai and Clip Studio Paint using a Wacom Bamboo Create tablet. Portraits are my favorite thing to draw but I do scenery and fantasy as well. I'm currently minoring in graphic design to utilize my skills for more than just personal art and aesthetics! </p>
